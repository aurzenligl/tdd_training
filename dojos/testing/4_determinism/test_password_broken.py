    This test is "flaky". It fails once per 500 runs or so,

    Such tests are constant source of misery for programmers
    who are involved to solve problems in one part of project
    and experience failing tests in other part. Such fails are
    unrelated to programmer's changes, but he doesn't know this

    Any change in gen_password implementation will change the
    order of characters, even though seed is set. This is fragile.

    This test expects that gen_password uses "random" module.
    What if it doesn't? It could use random device or C extension
    module as source of randomness. Changing random seed in these
    cases is meaningless and test will (almost) every time.
