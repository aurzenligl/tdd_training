# This is O(scary), but seems quick enough in practice.


# Magic. Do not touch.


# Dear maintainer:
#
# Once you are done trying to 'optimize' this routine,
# and have realized what a terrible mistake that was,
# please increment the following counter as a warning
# to the next guy:
#
# total_hours_wasted_here = 42


# sometimes I believe compiler ignores all my comments


# I dedicate all this code, all my work, to my wife, Darlene, who will
# have to support me and our three children and the dog once it gets
# released into the public.
