'''
Class introduces a set of member variables which are accessible to all methods.
In order not to break encapsulation, one should limit the amount of state (variables) to bare minimum,
which is necessary, and use other classes to keep the rest of state.

Sometimes a couple of free functions and built-in types is all that it takes...
